# Welcome to hax

hax is a tool for high assurance translations that translates a large subset of
Rust into formal languages such as [F\*](https://www.fstar-lang.org/) or [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/).
This extends the scope of the hacspec project, which was previously a DSL embedded in Rust,
to a usable tool for verifying Rust programs.
