# Continuous Integration (CI)

## Github Actions
 - [`add_to_project`](./.github/workflows/add_to_project.yml): each
   time an issue or a PR is open, this action adds it to the project
   [https://github.com/orgs/hacspec/projects/1](https://github.com/orgs/hacspec/projects/1).
 - [`release`](./.github/workflows/release.yml): whenever a tagged
   commit is pushed, this action builds the Linux binary, MacOS
   binary and JS of `circus-engine`, and uploads them to a new GitHub
   release.
 - [`format`](./.github/workflows/format.yml): ensure formatting for
   Rust and OCaml files.
 - [`specs`](./.github/workflows/specs.yml): compiles the toolchain
   (using Nix) and runs it on (for now) a selection of the examples
   provided by [hacspec/specs](https://github.com/hacspec/specs). For
   now this only tests the extraction of the specifications to Coq and
   FStar, we do not run Coq or FStar on the extractions.
 - [`test_installs`](./.github/workflows/test_installs.yml): compiles
   the toolchain on two versions of Ubuntu and two versions of MacOS
   using `apt` or `homebrew` and the `setup.sh` script.
 
## Pull Requests & Bors
Each commit pushed to a pull request triggers the actions `specs` and
`format`.

When a PR is reviewed and ready to be merged, one should not press the
merge button, but should comment `bors +r` in the PR. This will call
the [Bors bot](https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng), which will
additionally run the action `test_installs`, and merge automatically
if that latter action is successful.

Note Bors also ensures that PRs are up to date and merged one at a
time.
